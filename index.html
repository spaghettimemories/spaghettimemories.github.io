I guess you could say I’m a big pasta fan.<br>
A spaghetti head.<br>
Al dente tho. That’s that shit. Meatballs. A good meatball cmon.<br>
For awhile I was dating a vegetarian and she cooked awesome vegetarian dinners but then she broke up with me.<br>
I kept being a vegetarian for a while.<br>
I ate these meatless meatballs and felt very zen<br>
Also very depressed<br>
Now eat meat meatballs<br>
Still depressed but when i have a big plate of spaghetti with meatballs i do feel happy<br>

The first dinner I ate with my wife was spaghetti. She came to visit me in LA. My apartment was in a section run by the 18th street gang I guess. One time I saw a man get burned alive. I couldn’t bring myself to run over and try to put the fire out. Other people did. I think about that and worry about the kind of person I am.<br>
The spaghetti had shrimp in it.<br>
We also went to an itailan restaurant in LA and both had spaghetti and sat side by side. It was a piano bar and very romantic.<br>
Spaghetti is romantic<br>
Romantic things kill you<br>
