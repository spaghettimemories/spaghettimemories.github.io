  I guess the only thing that comes to mind is it was my 21st birthday. my parents cooked me a chicken parm and linguine dinner that sunday after I had partied for 2 days straight. That sunday, I was exhausted and I had smoked some kind of synthetic pot at my friend’s house, not k2 but a milder form i think, and went home for the spaghetti dinner zonked out and zombie-like. I remember eating the pasta extremely careful and slow, head on one hand, and my mom had said something like “man you look exhausted. partied out, huh?”
    and I remember confusing the linguine for my lips like running off my face and I had to slurp them back up

  I was gifted an olive garden gift card recently by a client<br>
  I’ve been having spaghetti lunch pronto every wednesday for the last month<br><br>

  a deeper spaghetti memory is that there used the be a place in Wichita called the Old Spaghetti Factory
  went there as a treat as a kid<br>
  a bizzare place<br>
  here's a story about it<br>
  <a href="https://www.kansas.com/entertainment/restaurants/dining-with-denise-neil/article224531755.html" target="_blank">The glory of Spaghetti Mizithra and more details about Wichita’s Old Spaghetti Factory</a><br><br>

  imagine a haunted factory as an italian restaurant<br><br>

  actually the spaghetti place was called Spaghetti Works<br>
  that article gets into the confusion<br>
  So Old Spaghetti Factory, Spaghetti Works, and Spaghetti Warehouse are all three different things<br>
  Spaghetti Works being a local franchise of Spaghetti Warehouse<br><br>

  fucking memories man<br>
  this is some real Mandala effect shit
