Sadly spaghetti is slowly killing me. I think when I eat spaghetti I eat too much of it. Why do your favorite things kill you? I have tried edamame-based spaghetti, it's ok. But I need that pure spaghetti. I don't remember the first time I ate spaghetti but I remember going to a place called the Spaghetti Factory in Pittsburgh on a family trip. It was good. We went to a Pirates vs San Diego Padres double header after that. When I was younger I wanted to be a major league baseball player but then I ate too much spaghetti. I mean that was part of it. The failure to realize my dream had something to do with being lazy and eating too much spaghetti. I used to rewind the scene in Goodfellas — the prison dinner scene where they are cutting the garlic and preparing the meal. The first time I saw Goodfellas I went out and stole some cigarettes from Turkey Hill. Then me and my brother and stepbrothers bought cap guns and jumped out of bushes and surprised joggers and popped off the cap guns. Seems insane now. I jog now and would be pissed if that happened. It's crazy what you do when you're a kid. And it's weird that spaghetti is connected to mafia movies and murder. For a while, we got into stealing the little chrome tire caps from luxury cars and putting them on our bikes. One time we were on our way to visit our aunt and we were at the train station in Philly and we were gonna steal the caps from this BMW. It turned out to belong to the Philadelphia Phillies center fielder Lenny Dykstra. Later I saw him in the train station. I went up (I was like 12) and introduced myself and said I played baseball too and he interrupted me and asked how to find the 2 p.m. train from DC. I showed him how you look at the schedule. I was pretty surprised he couldn't figure it out. I remember hearing that Lenny Dystra never read books. But he got rich from stocks and a car wash scam I think. I think he's kind of fucked up now. Anyway making pasta is easy. And fun. I really like farfalle. I'm writing this at a conference about growing hemp. This guy keeps saying the name Hawaiian Haze and Bubba Kush. He said he named a lot of the plants. He seems pretty excited. I think it's easy to eat a lot of spaghetti. That's one of my problems I guess.<br>
<br>
I guess you could say I'm a big pasta fan.<br>
A spaghetti head.<br>
Al dente tho. That's that shit. Meatballs. A good meatball c'mon.<br>
For awhile I was dating a vegetarian and she cooked awesome vegetarian dinners but then she broke up with me.<br>
I kept being a vegetarian for a while.<br>
I ate these meatless meatballs and felt very zen<br>
Also very depressed<br>
Now eat meat meatballs<br>
Still depressed but when i have a big plate of spaghetti with meatballs i do feel happy<br>
<br>
The first dinner I ate with my wife was spaghetti. She came to visit me in LA. My apartment was in a section run by the 18th st. gang I guess. They were pretty nice to me tho. One time I saw a man get burned alive. I couldn't bring myself to run over and try to put the fire out. Other people did. I think about that and worry about the kind of person I am.<br>
The spaghetti had shrimp in it.<br>
We also went to an itailan restaurant in LA and both had spaghetti and sat side by side. It was a piano bar and very romantic.<br>
Spaghetti is romantic.<br>
Romantic things kill you.

as a student i worked at this concert venue along other students. all on a volunteer basis. i made posters and such, you know, work that isn't really work. i was in it for short hours, cheap beer and free concerts. once every semester we had to do some actual volunteer work around the venue. cleaning, lime plastering the walls, take old syringes out of the brick wall gaps, stuff like that. as a reward for spending a hungover sunday we always got a free dinner. very often it was spaghetti and mince. first come first serve. for some reason i was late to dinner, and what was left was just this big ball of overcooked spaghetti in the bottom of this enormous casserole. you could scoop it like ice cream. tepid, dry and savory ice cream. it wasn't life changing or anything. it's for sure a dish i would comment on the ‘mouthfeel' of if i ever was a judge on masterchef. telling the contestants that to check if it was done, they can just throw spaghetti at the kitchen cabinets.

  I guess the only thing that comes to mind is it was my 21st birthday. my parents cooked me a chicken parm and linguine dinner that sunday after I had partied for 2 days straight. That sunday, I was exhausted and I had smoked some kind of synthetic pot at my friend’s house, not k2 but a milder form i think, and went home for the spaghetti dinner zonked out and zombie-like. I remember eating the pasta extremely careful and slow, head on one hand, and my mom had said something like “man you look exhausted. partied out, huh?”
    and I remember confusing the linguine for my lips like running off my face and I had to slurp them back up

  I was gifted an olive garden gift card recently by a client<br>
  I’ve been having spaghetti lunch pronto every wednesday for the last month<br><br>

  a deeper spaghetti memory is that there used the be a place in Wichita called the Old Spaghetti Factory<br>
  went there as a treat as a kid<br>
  a bizzare place<br>
  here's a story about it<br>
  <a href="https://www.kansas.com/entertainment/restaurants/dining-with-denise-neil/article224531755.html" target="_blank">The glory of Spaghetti Mizithra and more details about Wichita’s Old Spaghetti Factory</a><br><br>

  imagine a haunted factory as an italian restaurant<br><br>

  actually the spaghetti place was called Spaghetti Works<br>
  that article gets into the confusion<br>
  So Old Spaghetti Factory, Spaghetti Works, and Spaghetti Warehouse are all three different things<br>
  Spaghetti Works being a local franchise of Spaghetti Warehouse<br><br>

  fucking memories man<br>
  this is some real Mandala effect shit
